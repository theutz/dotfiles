# ZSH

# Because NuShell isn't POSIX compliant, it doesn't make sense to use it for our login =$SHELL=. Lots of programs expect that POSIX compliance from the system shell, so goofing with that isn't a good idea. NuShell knows that, and it lets you inherit environment variables from your system shell that will be available in your =env.nu= and =config.nu= files, as well as any interactive shell. So, let's define our =.zshenv= file here.


# [[file:.config/nushell/nushell.org::*ZSH][ZSH:1]]
export XDG_CONFIG_HOME="${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"
[[ -d $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zsh ]] && export ZDOTDIR="$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zsh"
source "$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv"
# ZSH:1 ends here
