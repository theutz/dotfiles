# The Utz Stack: My Personal Dotfiles

Welcome to **The Utz Stack**, a curated collection of my personal dotfiles.
While these configurations may not be universally applicable, they reflect my
unique workflow and preferences, crafted over countless hours of coding and
customization.

In this repository, youâ€™ll find the tools and settings that make my development
environment efficient and enjoyable. From tailored scripts to handy aliases,
each file is a product of my journey as a developer, designed to streamline my
processes and enhance my productivity.

Feel free to explore, but keep in mind that these dotfiles are tailored
specifically for my needs. They serve as a glimpse into my coding style rather
than a one-size-fits-all solution. If you find inspiration or ideas that
resonate with you, great! If not, consider this a snapshot of my personal
setup.
